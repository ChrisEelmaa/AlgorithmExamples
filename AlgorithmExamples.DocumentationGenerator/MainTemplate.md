#Introduction
This repository is used to study different algorithms & data structures.

I have provided unit tests (xUnit). These make sure that algorithms are mainly correct (I hope they're 100% correct, but you can never be sure. 

Dependencies:

- VS2013
- xUnit VS2013 test runner
- WebEssentials (markdown files)

Hope you find this as useful, as I did when I wrote the stuff :). This is an on-going project, which will last for years. 

My goal is to keep studying/adding new algorithms. I'd love this repo that have 1000 algorithms eventually.
