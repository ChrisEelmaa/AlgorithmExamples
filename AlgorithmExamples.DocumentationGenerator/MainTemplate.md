#Introduction
This repository is used to study different **algorithms**, ranging from sorting, to manipulating strings. Some of the algorithms depend
on different data structures, which I have also implemented.

In the sense, this project can also be used to learn more about data structures,
however, that is not the main focus of this project.

**These algorithms are used only for studying. 
This is not an actual C# algorithm library.
I have written algorithms in a way which make them not suitable to use in 
projects. They can be, often times, be a little slower, as source code clarity is
the number one factor here. **

I have provided unit tests (xUnit). These make sure that algorithms are mainly correct (I hope they're 100% correct, but you can never be sure. 

**Dependencies:**

- VS2013
- xUnit VS2013 test runner
- WebEssentials (markdown files)

Hope you find this as useful, as I did when I wrote the stuff :). This is an on-going project, which will last for years. 

My goal is to keep studying/adding new algorithms. 
I'd love this repo to have **1000** algorithms eventually.
