#Introduction
This repository is used to study different **algorithms**, ranging from sorting, to manipulating strings. Some of the algorithms depend
on different data structures, which I have also implemented.

In the sense, this project can also be used to learn more about data structures,
however, that is not the main focus of this project.

I have provided unit tests (xUnit). These make sure that algorithms are mainly correct (I hope they're 100% correct, but you can never be sure. 

**Dependencies:**

- VS2013
- xUnit VS2013 test runner
- WebEssentials (markdown files)

Hope you find this as useful, as I did when I wrote the stuff :). This is an on-going project, which will last for years. 

My goal is to keep studying/adding new algorithms. I'd love this repo that have 1000 algorithms eventually. 

#Overview
Current progress; **3**/1000 algorithms.

Amount of tests; TODO.

# Implementations
[BubbleSort](https://github.com/ChrisEelmaa/AlgorithmExamples/blob/master/Sorting/ComparisonBased/BubbleSort.cs) 

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, 
is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, 
compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

------------
[InsertionSort](https://github.com/ChrisEelmaa/AlgorithmExamples/blob/master/Sorting/ComparisonBased/InsertionSort.cs) 

Insertion sort is an elementary sorting algorithm that sorts one element at a time. 
Most humans, when sorting a deck of cards, will use a strategy similar to insertion sort. 
The algorithm takes an element from the list and places it in the correct location in the list.

------------
[SelectionSort](https://github.com/ChrisEelmaa/AlgorithmExamples/blob/master/Sorting/ComparisonBased/SelectionSort.cs) 

In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. 
It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, 
and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
