# AlgorithmExamples
This repository is used to study different algorithms.

I have provided unit tests. These make sure that algorithms are mainly correct (I hope they're 100% correct, but you can never be sure. 

Language used is C#.

Hope you find this as useful, as I did when I wrote the stuff :)
